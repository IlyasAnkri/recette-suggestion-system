title: Create MongoDB Data Models and Seed Initial Recipe/Ingredient Data
decision: CONCERNS
reviewer: Quinn (QA)
date: 2025-12-21
updated: 2025-12-21T13:30:00Z
rationale:
  - Core infrastructure (schemas, indexes, seeding) is production-ready
  - Auto-index creation enabled (critical fix applied)
  - Seed data volume pragmatically kept minimal for dev/test
  - Embedding generation appropriately deferred to Story 2.3
  - Production dataset expansion documented as pre-deployment requirement
must_fix:
  - None for current development phase
production_requirements:
  - Generate full seed dataset (50+ recipes, 200+ ingredients) before production deployment
  - Complete Story 2.3 for embedding generation
considerations:
  - Team should decide whether to update ACs to reflect current scope
evidence:
  - services/shared/src/main/resources/seed-data/recipes.json (5 recipes)
  - services/shared/src/main/resources/seed-data/ingredients.json (~60 ingredients)
  - services/shared/src/main/java/com/recipeadjuster/shared/service/DataSeedService.java
  - services/ingredient-matching-service/src/main/resources/application.yml (auto-index-creation: true)
  - services/recipe-search-service/src/main/resources/application.yml (auto-index-creation: true)
