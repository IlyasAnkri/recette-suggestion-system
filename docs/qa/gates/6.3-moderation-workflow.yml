    must_fix:
      - "Decide whether email notifications are required for this release; if yes, implement and test them, otherwise document an explicit waiver."
    monitor:
      - "Monitor moderation throughput and failure patterns once email and Kafka are fully wired."
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Align AC and implementation boundaries between Stories 6.3 and 6.6 (Kafka responsibilities)."
  future:
    - "Add audit logging for all moderation decisions (approve/reject) for compliance."
