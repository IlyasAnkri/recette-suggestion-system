- Build community-driven recipe database reaching 500 contributed recipes within 6 months of launch
- Achieve 1,000 active users within 3 months and 10,000 within 6 months through organic growth
- Operate within zero-budget constraint using free-tier infrastructure for first 6 months
- Maintain 99% uptime and <2 second response time for AI substitution queries
- Empower cooking confidence through educational content explaining cooking principles and substitution chemistry

### Background Context

Recipe Adjuster addresses a critical problem facing home cooks globally: inefficient use of available ingredients leading to food waste ($1,500-2,000 annually per household), unnecessary grocery spending, and decision fatigue. Existing recipe apps focus on cuisine-based discovery rather than ingredient optimization, and those offering ingredient-based search lack intelligent substitution guidance, offline functionality, and educational value.

The convergence of rising food costs (20% increase 2020-2024), growing sustainability awareness among Gen Z and Millennials, and AI technology maturation (Spring AI, local LLMs) creates a unique market opportunity. With 82% of meals now prepared at home post-pandemic, users are primed for a solution combining ingredient optimization with AI-powered cooking assistance. Recipe Adjuster differentiates through Spring AI-powered substitution explanations (not just 1:1 mappings), semantic ingredient search, offline-first PWA architecture, and cooking education—all delivered at zero cost using free-tier infrastructure (Spring Boot microservices, Angular 20, Kafka, Supabase, Netlify).
